## Managing Developer Workflows with the Kubernetes API - Colin Murphy, Adobe

### Why?
- Greater control over the process
- Reduce cognitive load
- Interface with existing deployment system and change management
- Secret Management
- Not that hard

### Greater Control
e.g. Limit options of end developers.

### Reduce cognitive load
... for developers. Create an abstraction for developers to get them running more quickly.

### Not that hard
Golang k8s API is most mature.

### Requirements
- Existing service configuration
- Low learning curve / high ceiling
- One repo per microservice: configuration, objects, code in the repository
- Can customize

### Low learning curve
Need teams to migrate almost immediately.

### Hermetic Deployments

### Can customize
Glue together technologies that may not have obvious insertion points.
