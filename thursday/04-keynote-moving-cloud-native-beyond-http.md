### DNS
Create a DNS service. It is a suite of services. AWS Route 53 is an implementation of DNS spec.

### IoT protocols
- MQTT
- OPC
- lightweightM2M
- CoAP
- Weave
- CAN bus
- BACnet

### Internet of Things
Challenge of implementing any given protocols are also present in gaming, telcos/5G, video conferencing, core infra (NTP)
