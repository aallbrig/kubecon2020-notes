## Sponsored Session: What Happened to the Promise of Cloud Computing? - Doug Davis, IBM Cloud

### Cloud Computing Promise
As you evolve, you don't need to worry about infrastructure as much and can focus more on the business logic of your app.

"Breaking up the monolith" "Targeted Scaling" "Better resource utilization" All about abstracting the infrastructure. Have we been successful?

Comparing these three aspects: (1) Containers/kubernetes, (2) Apps/PaaS/cloud foundry, (3) Fn/Serverless/ Openwhisk.

Comparison Metrics between the three aspects - Simplified UX, Containers, Micro-services/smallish tasks, stateless, endpoint + load balancing, build, pay per usage, on-demand infrastructure - auto scaling, access to advanced infrastructure features, Event driven/tooling, scale to zero, async tasks, non-restrictive task execution times, non-restrictive resource usage

### Choices mean work!
As we break up the monolith...
- Each component requires different runtime characteristics/platform?
- Does each platform require a different devops pipeline?
- Integrate workloads across these platforms? Securely?!
- Triple the learning curve and management

### Kubernetes wins?
Kubernetes is the target platform that is being refactored into for most PaaS platforms. This causes some pain...

You are on your own for some important aspects of operating your application.

"I just want to focus on code as a developer"

### Progress has begun
Community chatter
- Lines between platforms is becoming blurry
- Its all just containers
- K8s UX concerns
- Kubernetes is not the end-game
